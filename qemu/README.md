# QEMU

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
Check the [home](https://www.qemu.org) of QEMU for more information.

However, QEMU is not enough for our analysis. We want QEMU to provide us with more traces.

## install
see project [README.md](../README.md).

## start
Use QEMU as usual.
