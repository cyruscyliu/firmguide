	  Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) is a privilege escalation
	  vulnerability in the Linux Kernel. A race condition was
	  found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled
	  the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only
	  memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use
	  this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory
	  mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system.
